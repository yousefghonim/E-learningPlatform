# E-learningPlatform
This project is a full-stack e-learning platform designed to help learners and instructors interact efficiently online, similar to Udemy. Students can search for courses, enroll, track progress, and leave reviews, while instructors can create, manage, and organize course content. Admins have tools to monitor the platform.
